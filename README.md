# Spaghetti!
Update: 
 - Added checkbox to disable red ocean. 
 - Added button to remove red ocean from existing save (will need to save and load to take effect)
 
Update: Increased Planet Size to 500. Whoops.

 - Custom Scenario for Galactic Scale 2 mod.

 - You've managed to get yourself into quite a mess!

 - The giant planet is covered in sauce, and immovable ore veins.

 - You will have to build around these obstacles in order to win the game.

 - I spent two hours on this, and it shows. Might give it a visual overhaul in the future.

 - Soil Pile is free, click the vein bury tool.

 Good luck!
